Comments to the author
======================

The authors presented methods to computing the maximal
robust positively invariant sets for linear discrete-time
systems with additive model uncertainty. The simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
methods.

In my opinion this paper is well organized and written, and
the results obtained in this paper sounds theoretically
correct. So I think this paper could be accepted. The
following concerns may need to be considered.

1. It will be preferable is the authors provide more
details to express the relation
$\Psi^{-l}K_1\subseteq\Psi^{-l}X_0$ which is stated in the
proof of Lemma 3.1.

There may be some typos in the following sentences.

2. page 3, "...we can compute a the maximal robust..."

3. page 3, "...a linearised simplified model of the
magnetic levitation system depict in figure 1."
